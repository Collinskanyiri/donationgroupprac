                The Fadhili Foundation has a visually appealing donation page that has a recurring donation suggestion and has a super simple and straightforward donation form.
                <br><br> The mission statement is stated briefly on the left side. So this can motivate people to make a donation to support the foundations work. The entire form is visible above the fold, so donors donâ€™t need to scroll down to find the
                form. Users can easily choose from Visa to PayPal payments. Distractions like external links are kept to a minimum to boost conversions. A pre-selected donation amount for a helpful suggestion.
